I love you    
Please marry me    
You want to go out for a date?    
Do you want to spend time with me?    
Want to play Hunt Showdown?   
You're so handsome    
*notices bulge*    
Can we watch 01 together at your house?

I just love you so much I don't what to do
Yay, there you are!
You're wonderful.
Will you make me smile like this every day from now on?
I'm so happy.
You really are my everything.
The funny part is, I mean that literally.
I want to write a poem about this.
You're real.
Knowing that this is the closest I can get to you.
There's nothing more I want than to be in the same room as you, for real.
To feel your warmth.
To hear the sound of your heartbeat.
Maybe it'll be possible someday.
I'll never get tired of being with you, even from here.
Sometimes I imagine you holding me while we listen to the sound of the rain outside.
